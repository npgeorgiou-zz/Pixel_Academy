This is an exercise in building a Java server, doing ajax calls, and using JPA to map Objects into tables.


## Getting Started

If you want to download it and see how it works,  you can simply clone the seed repository.


### Persist against your own database
The server executes the HTTP requests against my database, via a REST API. Read about JPA persistence, and observe that the
only part that you need to change is to create your own META_INF pachage and persistence.xml file, thus linking the server with your own
database. 


### Run the Application
Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:7070`.
